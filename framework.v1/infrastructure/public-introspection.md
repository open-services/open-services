# Public Introspection

Traditionally, developers working on the infrastructure have a special view into the infrastructure, compared to developers who work on the code being deployed. 

Open Services aims to make this special view available for anyone, as anyone can help spot issues in the running infrastructure.

However, extra carefulness needs to be applied, as some information can hurt individuals if public. For example, IPs, email-addresses and other "secrets" should be masked to protect individuals and the integrity of the infrastructure.
