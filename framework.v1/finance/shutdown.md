# Shutdown

Before starting the service, it should clearly defined what happens with the current funds in the case the service is not able to become self-sustainable in the long-term.

Things to consider:

- Where the excess funds go
  - Donating to another non-profit
  - Refunding donations to users
- How to cancel services being paid for monthly
  - Publish all confirmations that they been cancelled
- See more considerations in `framework.v1/product/shutdown.md`
