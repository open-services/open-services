# Self-Funded

A Open Service should only be funded by it's users and public entities. A Open Service should not be privately funded by a for-profit company or similar organizations.

The Open Service should expose one or more ways for any user to send either a) one time donations or b) setup a interval donation that happens either every day, week, month or year. The donation amount in both scenarios should be set by the donator.

The amount chosen by the donator should not affect the donators chance to participate in the project nor should they earn any extra benefits depending on donation amount.
