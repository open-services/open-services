# Public History

All the transactions that happen for the service, should be publicly viewable.

This include all expenses spent on services, all incoming donations and everything in-between.

Expenses need to have the full details (excluding payment details) visible on
the published expense report.

- Who paid it?
- To who?
- For what?
- How much is the expense?
- What is the period we're being billed for?

Expenses include any salaries paid to full-time/part-time developers who help maintain the service as well.

Incoming donations are more relaxed as donors might want to be anonymous. What has to be clear:

- What the donation is for (name of the service)
- How much the donation was
- If it's periodic/one-time
