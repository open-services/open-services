# Efficiency of Funds

As all the funds received by the service is from people wanting the service to survive as long as possible, it's important to spend the funds wisely.

The funds should only be used where absolutely needed and all decisions need to take financing into account.

It's better to start the service small and cheap, and grow it whenever it's needed, rather than trying to anticipate demand and overshoot, possibly spend people's funds that were not needed to have been spent.
