## Paid Contributions

Some organizations pay developers to contribute to Open Source projects but it's not clear they are being paid for doing that work. It creates the false-impression that there is more voluntary contributions than there is in reality.

We need to avoid this situation and be 100% clear about who is getting paid for working on a service, how much they are getting paid, how long the collaboration is planned for and what we expect to be done during that period of time.
