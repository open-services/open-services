# Phases

Each Open Service is described to be in a specific `phase`, so users know what
to expect from the current running service.

These are the phases a service can be in:

- Evaluating
- Starting
- Operating
- Closing
- Closed

Here follows a rough sketch on what each of the phases means for the project

## Evaluating

The service has yet to be fully defined, and might not even get started unless
there is enough support for it.

At this point, it's important to understand what the service is about,
the feasibility of running it and what it's goal should be.

There should be a clear need for it, where either there is something similar
already running but it's driven by a for-profit agenda, or there used to be
something similar but the entity behind it was unable to make it sustainable.

## Starting

The service has already been identified to serve a clear need, and now the
involved people starts working on running it and making it self-sustainable.

## Operating

The service fulfills the framework for their chosen version and will go from
there.

## Closing

The runway of the service is starting to run out and in order to avoid a rush
and short time for export/migration, the service needs to declare that it is
closing.

Users should have plenty of time for alternatives, rule of thumb could be 6 months.

## Closed

The service went through the previous stages and is now
