# Offline First

While a Open Service is inherently online, the service should facilitate offline-usage as much as possible.

As a Open Service, we don't have need to make sure all connections goes via our servers. That means, we can utilize P2P and similar technologies, to enable a "Offline First" use case.

Services should keep this requirement in mind while developing new features, and should try to make it possible.
