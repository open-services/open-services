# Single Product Focus

As each service has it's own funding, the service should try to focus as much as possible on one core value to deliver on. 

Once the product focus has been decided, it cannot change.

If a need for a different focus is identified, a new service should be created to fulfill this need.

Users who identify more with the new service, should be able to easily move their donation and/or contribution workflow to the new service.
