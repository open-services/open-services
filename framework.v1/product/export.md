# Export

The service should allow users, at any point in time, to export all their published data.

The export functionality needs to be working from the `Operating` phase, until the end of `Closing` phase.

There should be no limitations on how many times a user can export their data.

The data should be exported in the most user friendly format for that type of data.

When possible, the format should be a Open format[0]
