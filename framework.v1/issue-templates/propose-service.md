This issue is proposing the evaluation of a new Open Service.

Please consider the questions carefully and answer them to the best of your
ability.

Try to include as much of your motivation for the creation of the service as
possible, without being overly verbose.

Don't be afraid to submit a proposal that you fear might get rejected or not
pick up demand for being started. There is still valuable lessons to be learned
from the discussions about it.
